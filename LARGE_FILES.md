The project uses several large files that are not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limitations:

### reviews.csv (143MB)
- Contains movie reviews and metadata scrapped from IMDb
- Used for training and querying the recommendation system
- Can be generated by running the `webscrapping.py` script

### Cinematic_AI_Assistant.ipynb (514KB)
- Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation
- You can download this file directly from the repository

### Cinematic_AI_Assistant.pdf (154KB)  
- Project report with detailed explanation

## Obtaining Large Files
If you need these files:

1. For the reviews dataset, you can generate it by running the webscrapping script:
```bash
python webscrapping.py
```

2. Alternatively, you can contact the repository owner for direct access to the files.

## Storage Requirements
- Ensure you have approximately 200MB of free disk space to work with the full dataset.
- Additional space may be required for embedding indexes and model caches.
